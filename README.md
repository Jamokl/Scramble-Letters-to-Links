# Introduction
This repository contains a code that scrambles random given letters into a given format. The format being used is "https://www.{shuffled_letters}.com/{shuffled_letters}". This was chosen because it*s plausible that a link contains ".com/" + 
every link either needs "https" or "http" and www to work. In this case, the code uses https as its safer than http (can be changed). The skript scrambles 300 diffrent and completly random combinations into links and prints them to a ".txt" file which is being
saved to the folder containig your ".py" file. Additionaly, there are some words given, that might be contained in the link which is trying to be found. 

# Note 
This skript was created in response to the video ["Horrifying Discoveries in Minecraft Beta Footage"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtqXrhX8_DU]) uploaded to the channel [Wifies](https://www.youtube.com/@Wifies). The structure of the link might not be the 
right one, regardless it's a step into a direction that might lead to solving the puzzle.
